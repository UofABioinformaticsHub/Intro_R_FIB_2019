## VM Connection Instructions 

For the entire Fall Into Bioinformatics Course we'll be connecting to a virtual machine with all of the required software already installed.
This may be a bit difficult at the beginning, but I'm sure we'll have it sorted with the first hour or so.

### Windows Only

We'll assume you have `git bash` installed, so please open this to give yourself a terminal. 
If you don't have this installed, please do so [from here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.21.0.windows.1) as you'll need this all three days.

### All Operating Systems

Regardless of whether you run MacOS or a Linux system, you'll need a terminal for the initial connection.
Please open one and follow the instructions below VERY carefully

- Find out your assigned IP address and do not lose this information
- In the terminal type `ssh trainee@xx.xxx.xxx.x` where the `x` values represent your assigned IP address
- Your initial password is `trainee` however this will expire as soon as you enter it. Note that when you are typing passwords, no characters will appear and you may (mistakenly) think that nothing is working.
- Once you have entered your password and been given access, follow the instructions to create a new password. **Please remember this password** as you will use it for the next 3 days.
- You will then be logged out and there's no real need to login with your terminal again until Tuesday.

Now we have setup your access, open your usual inernet browser and go to `xx.xxx.xxx.x:8787` where once again the `x` values represent your assigned IP address.

- A login to RStudio should appear and you can login using `trainee` as your username, and using the password you have just created.
- That's it. The setup is now done!
